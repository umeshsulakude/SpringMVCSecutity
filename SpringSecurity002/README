Spring Security Notes: 
my refference 002

1> Before we create we need to know.
UserDetails is Interface and User is class implemented this interface and overridden few of its methods.
2>GrantedAuthority interface and SimpleGrantedAuthority is the class which implemented this interface.
3> In SecurityAppConfig if you observe methos setups we have hard coded username and password.
4> USerDetailsManager is interface there are two class implement it below are the classes
InMemoUserDetailsManager and JdbcUserDetailsManager.

5> First try with inmemoryuserdetails as example :
see the class SecurityAppCofnig for the method -> setup()
if you run this you ll get below error that password must be encrypted.
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: There is no PasswordEncoder mapped for the id "null"

6> To remove this you need to encrypted password or their is quick fix you can using NoOpPasswordEncoder class.
    @Bean
    PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return NoOpPasswordEncoder.getInstance();
    }

7> Now run the app and Add username and passwords. you should login.
8> next project is to run the same app with JdbcUserDetailsManager
