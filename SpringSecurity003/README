Spring Security Notes: 
my refference 003


1> read about user class and userdetails interface
2> UserBuilder class which is inner class of user. read about this

3 > Compare the commented lines and new code written in securityAppConfig.
 We can directly use USer class which is provided by Spring. Instead of creating grantauthority interface and setting it to inmemomoryuserdetailsmanager class.
